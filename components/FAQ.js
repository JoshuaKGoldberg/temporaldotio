            Most developers hand-write async flows using queues and job processors.
          </h2>
          <p>
            This often requires requisitioning new infrastructure, and hand-writing often buggy,
            not-well-distributed and hard-to-test code. Temporal offers a battle tested framework
            enabling you to capture and define your business logic in a structured way and run it it
            atop a single set of infrastructure at massive scale. It allows developers to focus on
            your actual business requirements and not plumbing work.

        <VSItem header="DAG-based Workflow Engines">
          <h2 className="font-bold mb-3">
            DAG-based Workflow Engines like Airflow/Prefect/Luigi are pipeline solutions aimed at
            data scientists running at a small-to-medium scale.
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Temporal provides a code-first development environment which can be used to build data
            pipelines, orchestrate microservices, provision resources and much more at any scale.
            Code written with Temporal is executed directly which enables users to easily integrate
            Temporal into their existing development, testing, and debugging environmentss.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            While Temporal is a great option for data pipelines, this encompasses only a very small
            subset of its use cases. Temporal enables development of applications of all shapes and
            sizes, regardless of scale.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Temporal targets developers. All code written with Temporal runs directly, eliminating
            any extra compilation steps often required by DAG-based solutions. This provides extra
            flexibility which is impossible to achieve with more rigid DAG based systems.

        <VSItem header="BPM Engines">
          <h2 className="font-bold mb-4">
            BPM Engines like Camunda Zeebe define their workflows using a flow-chart based DSL such
            as BPMN.
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Flow-chart based workflow DSLs suffer from being bound to a specific set of features and
            capabilities provided by the underlying workflow language they use. Even though they
            promote the visualization aspect of workflow design, the actual execution semantics are
            expressed as a mix of programming and expression languages which are enforced by the
            specific runtime implementation. Temporal does not suffer from these types of
            restrictions enabling you to fully define your workflows using a programming language.
            This provides a high level of flexibility not only with defining your workflow logic but
            also testing and debugging in the development environment of your choice.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            BPM engines translate workflow definition markup into code, which requires additional
            compilation steps. This kind of code generation is approached differently by each
            runtime engine using tools they chose. Temporal eliminates the intermediate compilation
            steps enabling you to express your workflow logic directly in code. In addition,
            Temporal provides you with high-level concepts such as asynchronous invocations,
            retries, error propagation and compensation which can be expressed much easier than in
            BPM-based solutions, especially for larger workflows.

          <h2 className="font-bold mb-4">
            JSON/YAML-based Workflow Engines like AWS Step Functions are aimed at high scale, light
            complexity applications.{' '}
          </h2>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Workflow engines based on declarative DSLs contain a very small set of features and
            typically target very specific technology domains. Similar to BPM-based engines, they
            require additional compilation steps to translate the workflow definitions into
            executable code. They also often target stateless orchestration use cases only. Temporal
            not only eliminates the intermediate compilation steps allowing you to express your
            workflow logic directly in code, but it also targets a much larger set of use cases. It
            can be used to build data pipelines, orchestrate microservices, provision resources and
            much more. Code written with Temporal is executed directly which enables users to easily
            develop, debug, and test their workflows using a development environment of their
            choice.

            Step Functions can be a great service for non-developers or technical managers to define
            business logic without writing code. While Step Functions is a great service there is no
            open source implementation provided which puts it into a much different class compared
            to Temporal.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Temporal is an open source platform which enables you to deploy your workflow
            applications on environments of your choice. Step Functions on the other hand is only
            available as a service from AWS.
          </p>
          <p className="mb-3">
            Temporal targets developers and all code written with Temporal runs directly instead of
            being translated from a DSL. This gives you flexibility which is impossible to achieve
            with more rigid DSL based systems.

            often not existing in domain-specific DSL based solutions.
